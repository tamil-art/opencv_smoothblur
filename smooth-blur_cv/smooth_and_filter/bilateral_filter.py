#Bilateral Filter- uses a Gaussian filter in the space domain, but it also uses one more (multiplicative) Gaussian
#filter component which is a function of pixel intensity differences

#APPLICATIONS: Highly effective at noise removal while preserving edges,in previous filtering edges will be blured
